# Predict-Future-Sales
It is from a kaggle competition where we have to predict the future sales using Machine Learning or Deep Learning. It is a Advanced Regression Problem where Statistics and time series analysis is also required. This problem can be very well done by Deep Learning's Model Recurrent Neural Networks.


You are provided with daily historical sales data. The task is to forecast the total amount of products sold in every shop for the test set. Note that the list of shops and products slightly changes every month. Creating a robust model that can handle such situations is part of the challenge.

# File descriptions

sales_train.csv - the training set. Daily historical data from January 2013 to October 2015.
test.csv - the test set. You need to forecast the sales for these shops and products for November 2015.
sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format.
items.csv - supplemental information about the items/products.
item_categories.csv  - supplemental information about the items categories.
shops.csv- supplemental information about the shops.
Data fields
ID - an Id that represents a (Shop, Item) tuple within the test set
shop_id - unique identifier of a shop
item_id - unique identifier of a product
item_category_id - unique identifier of item category
item_cnt_day - number of products sold. You are predicting a monthly amount of this measure
item_price - current price of an item
date - date in format dd/mm/yyyy
date_block_num - a consecutive month number, used for convenience. January 2013 is 0, February 2013 is 1,..., October 2015 is 33
item_name - name of item
shop_name - name of shop
item_category_name - name of item category

# Context

This challenge serves as final project for the "How to win a data science competition" Coursera course.

In this competition you will work with a challenging time-series dataset consisting of daily sales data, kindly provided by one of the largest Russian software firms - 1C Company. 

We are asking you to predict total sales for every product and store in the next month. By solving this competition you will be able to apply and enhance your data science skills.
